# PickerChallenge

This challenge works with several SwiftUI Picker options. It does see that there's a bug (on Apple side) when
definining the label for a Picker. I did address this in the comments and intend to revisit this in the future.

## Challenge

Build an app that lets users order a meal from your new restaurant, “Ottimo Ristorante”! The UI should have

* A menu picker that lets the user select one of Ottimo Ristorante’s many locations

* A wheel picker that lets the user choose what they want to eat

* A segmented picker that lets the user select what time they will pick up their order

* A button that says “Pick for me!”. When the button is tapped, the app should randomly select a location, meal and time for the user
