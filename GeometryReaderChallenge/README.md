# GeometryReader Challenge

This challenge gave me hands on experience working with the GeometryReader, which allows you to work with
available screen real estate, without knowing / needing to know the device.

The instructions were as followed:

Challenge

Build a UI that has

* A green rectangle that covers the top half of the screen

* A red rectangle that

  * Has width equal to two thirds of the screen’s width

  * Has height equal to one quarter the top half of the screen’s height

  * Is centered in the top half of the screen

* A purple rectangle that covers the left half of the bottom half of the screen

* An orange rectangle that covers the right half of the bottom half of the screen

Whenever a rectangle is tapped, the console should print its width and height.

All rectangles should ignore the safe area.

Make sure your solution works for different screen sizes!
