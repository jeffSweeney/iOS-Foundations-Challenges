# iOS-Foundations-Challenges

This repo will house various post-lecture challenges I've worked on in the iOS Foundations course.

Challenges prior to module 4 were rather trivial, so I'll omit those and just keep them locally.

NOTE: I will post subdirectory READMEs of the challenge. I tend to add a little extra when/where I 
      see fit, so if I stray from the baseline instructions, this is why.
